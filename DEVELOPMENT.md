# Development

The development workflow for this project is as follows:

* The `master` branch contains the latest (fully-working and documented)
  release
* The `development` branch is a staging area to consolidate the future release
  for merging back into `master`
    * Development branches should branch from this one
	* Completed features should be merged back into this branch
